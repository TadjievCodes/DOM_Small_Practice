An event received by an element doesn't stop with that one element. That event moves to other elements like the parent, 
and other ancestors of the element. This is called "event bubbling".
What is the callback function that is passed to addEventListener often called? Event Handler
A parent experiences the same event a child does because of event bubbling.
The Event Object like: Event.target example: " event.target.tagName == 'LI' "
